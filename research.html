          I use mathematical modeling and machine learning to understand how individual behaviour,

          <h3>Research statement</h3>
          <p>
            My work sits at the intersection of mathematical epidemiology, applied analysis, and data science.
            I develop mechanistic models that capture key biological and behavioural processes, and I integrate
            these models with modern statistical and machine learning approaches to guide decision-making in
            public and population health.
          </p>
          <p>
            A recurring theme in my research is the importance of <em>trustworthy</em> and <em>interpretable</em>
            models in settings where data are limited, noisy, or structurally biased. I am interested in how
            qualitative model structure, parameter uncertainty, and social context interact to produce complex
            dynamics, and in how we can design interventions that are effective, equitable, and robust to
            modelling assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Methodologically, I work with compartmental and hybrid mechanistic–data-driven models, optimal
            control, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (including LHS–PRCC pipelines), and numerical simulation.
            Substantively, my projects span infectious diseases, noncommunicable conditions such as obesity, and
            social phenomena such as crime, gang activity, and substance use, viewed through the lens of public
            health.

          <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Hybrid mechanistic–machine learning models for health systems.</strong>
              Linking compartmental or agent-based models with ML components to improve prediction and scenario
              analysis, while retaining interpretability and mechanistic insight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interventions, behaviour, and compliance.</strong>
              Studying how testing, isolation, treatment adherence, and fear-based deterrence influence disease
              transmission, crime dynamics, and other outcomes, using optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Uncertainty and sensitivity in complex models.</strong>
              Quantifying uncertainty in parameters and initial conditions, and identifying key leverage points for
              policy through global sensitivity analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equity and heterogeneity.</strong>
              Exploring how heterogeneity in risk, access, and behaviour shapes the impact of public health
              interventions and predictive models.
            </li>
